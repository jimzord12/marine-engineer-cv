# Framework gaps

Read this before planning framework work, and add to it whenever you go
around a component, template or contract to get a CV done (constitution
section 10). Newest at the bottom. Never delete an entry; mark it closed
when the gap is filled.

Each entry is a few lines:

```text
### YYYY-MM-DD  short title                          Status: open | closed by <ADR, PR or commit>
Needed:   what the owner or candidate required
Bypassed: which component, template or rule of the contract could not do it
Built:    what was done instead, and where (a private folder, an entry point, a one-off)
Lesson:   what the framework would need, in one sentence
```

A gap that appears a second time is a candidate for a component, a slot or
an extension. A third appearance makes it one (rule of three, ADR 0007).

## Entries

### 2026-09-12  Contract periods instead of service months          Status: open, roadmap item one
Needed:   A deck officer's career recorded as one date range per contract, with
          a synopsis counting contracts, vessels and companies.
Bypassed: The candidate schema (no field for periods), the experience section
          (rows carry months), the synopsis (months, vessels, companies).
Built:    A custom composition in the candidate's private folder: a hand-made
          vessel, rank and period table, a hand-made synopsis, periods kept in
          a separate `presentation.json`. See `docs/guides/build-a-cv.md`
          section 7.
Lesson:   The schema needs contract periods, and the synopsis needs its metrics
          declared by data.

### 2026-09-12  Three-column certificate table                     Status: open, roadmap item one
Needed:   An approved design with certificate, provider and date, no
          expiry column.
Bypassed: `certificate-table`, which renders four fixed cells per record.
Built:    A hand-made table in the private entry point.
Lesson:   The certificate table should take its columns from data or copy.

### 2026-09-12  Skills section inside the two-page layout           Status: open, roadmap item one
Needed:   A professional skills block at the bottom of page one.
Bypassed: The `flagship` template, which has no slot for it; the section
          exists only as a standalone export.
Built:    Placed by hand in a custom composition.
Lesson:   The template needs a slot for optional sections per page.
