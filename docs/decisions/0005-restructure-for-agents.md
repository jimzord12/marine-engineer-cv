# 0005. Restructure the repository for coding agents

Date: 2026-09-12
Status: Accepted

## Context

The repository carried eleven design revisions, fifteen review PDFs, ten
per-revision verification files at the root, Greek documentation and a
README written as a changelog. The active library was correct but hard to
find. The owner intends to keep developing with coding agents and wants a
tree that is navigable without reading history.

## Decision

- Remove flagship iterations 04 to 10 with their renders and verification
  records. Keep the four distinct studies under `designs/` as frozen worked
  examples. Everything removed stays under tag `archive/pre-restructure`.
- Rename `roles/` to `artwork/`; fold the duplicate theme into
  `golden-blue.typ`; move fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`, the frozen PDF
  under `reference/`, deliverables under `exports/`.
- Remove the legacy flat-schema adapter and its data files. Tests use the
  native schema.
- Replace Greek guides with an English documentation set: vision,
  architecture, tech stack, constitution, conventions, git workflow, history,
  per-concept references, ADRs, a JSON Schema, a build guide.
- Add `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, three project skills and a CI workflow.
- Add `typst.toml` so the library is a proper package.

## Consequences

- The engineer example still matches v11 exactly; the suite passed before
  and after.
- Anyone needing an intermediate revision checks out the tag.
- Docs have one language and one place per concept. Adding a concept means
  adding a file and a row in `AGENTS.md`.
- The hash manifest shrank from 44 to 31 entries and now covers the inputs
  the comparison actually uses, both example JSON files, and the four
  design studies with their data.
