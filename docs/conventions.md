# Conventions

How code, documents and commits are written here. Read before writing any of
them. These evolve; the rules that do not are in `constitution.md`.

## Typst code

- **Small functions that return content, one shape (ADR 0008).** A
  component takes `ctx` first, then the data it renders, then named props
  with defaults, then content slots: `#let name(ctx, data, prop: default,
  ..slots)`. `ctx` bundles `theme`, `layout`, `copy` and `options`; it is
  built once by the template and passed through untouched. Inside the
  function: validate, then the style block of `set` and `show` rules, then
  layout, then compose. Positional content arguments are children; named
  content arguments are named slots.
- **Migrate a module whole.** Until every module is migrated, an unmigrated
  file keeps the old order (data, theme, geometry slice). A file never
  mixes the two.
- **Parent owns outer spacing, child owns internal layout.** Never add an
  outer `v()` inside a component. A component reads its own slice,
  `ctx.layout.hero`, never a sibling's.
- **Tokens in themes, geometry in layouts, pictures in artwork.** A number
  with a unit inside `src/` is a smell unless it is a structural constant
  such as a 2pt rule.
- **Assert with a fix in the message.** `assert(..., message: "Name exceeds
  identity plate: adjust theme.sizes.name or hero.plate-width")`. The reader
  should not need the source to know what to change.
- **No role branches.** Deck versus engine is data, artwork and copy. A
  section that must differ is a slot or a data-selected variant, never a
  second template.
- **Related pieces stay together.** Hero and its five helpers are one file.
  A new file is justified by a new responsibility, not by line count.
- **Paths from the project root** for assets: `/assets/...`. Compile with
  `--root .`.
- **Naming:** kebab-case for functions, keys and files. Templates are named
  after the design, `flagship`, never after a role. Themes and artwork
  packs are named after what they look like, not after a revision number.
  Layouts carry the template and the reference they reproduce,
  `flagship-v11`.
- **Comments** explain a decision or a trap, never restate the code. One line
  at the top of a file says what the file owns.

## Candidate JSON

- Nested schema only: `identity`, `contacts`, `companies`, `certificates`,
  `education_entries`, `language_entries`, optional `profile`, `disclosure`,
  `copy`. Validate against `schema/candidate.schema.json`.
- Stable ids for companies and vessels. Whole service months.
- Display text is display text. Never encode data in a label.

## Tests

- A test exercises the real compiler and the real PDF. No mocks.
- A fixture under `tests/fixtures/` is a Typst file with `sys.inputs` cases.
  The Python runner selects cases and asserts on the output PDF.
- A test that would pass with the feature deleted is not written.
- Negative cases assert on the error message text.
- Prefer one compile case that covers a path over several that cover a mock.

## Documents

- English. Plain language. Lead with the answer.
- One concept per file under `docs/reference/`. First line says when to read
  it. Under about 100 lines.
- Anything with a shape (JSON, dictionary, command) is a code block with a
  one-line brief above it.
- Decisions go in `docs/decisions/NNNN-title.md` using the template in
  `docs/decisions/README.md`. History goes in `docs/history.md`. Neither is
  rewritten later; add a new entry.
- No emojis.

## Commits

Conventional Commits, imperative, under 72 characters on the first line:

```text
feat: add chief engineer artwork pack
fix: keep rank column fixed when a duration wraps
refactor: move page-plan validation into pagination.typ
docs: record decision to freeze v11
test: cover company split across three pages
chore: bump pinned Typst version
```

Body explains why and names the evidence folder when a render or suite run
backs the change.

## Versioning of deliverables

Rendered PDFs are named `Marine-<Role>-CV-<Variant>-vNN.pdf`. A new render
with visible changes gets a new number and a new file. Old files are removed
in the same commit unless they are a frozen reference.
