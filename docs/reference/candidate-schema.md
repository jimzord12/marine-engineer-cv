# Candidate schema

Read this when editing a candidate JSON. Machine-checkable version:
`schema/candidate.schema.json`. Runtime checks: `validate-candidate` in
`src/data.typ`.

Top-level shape. Required keys are `identity` and `companies`.

```json
{
  "identity":          { "name": "ALEX MORGAN", "rank": "SECOND ENGINEER",
                         "portrait": "/assets/fictional-engineer.png",
                         "portrait-alt": "AI-generated portrait" },
  "contacts":          { "left":  [ { "label": "Based in", "value": "Rotterdam, Netherlands" } ],
                         "right": [ { "label": "Email", "value": "a@example.com", "href": "mailto:a@example.com" } ] },
  "profile":           "Two or three sentences shown beside the vessel illustration.",
  "companies":         [ { "id": "northline", "name": "Northline Marine", "period": "2022 - 2026",
                           "groups": [ { "type": "Product tankers",

                                                      "rank": "Second Engineer", "months": 8 } ] } ] } ],
  "certificates":      [ ["Certificate of Competency", "Second Engineer / III/2", "15 Jul 2024", "14 Jul 2029"],
                         { "title": "...", "scope": "...", "issued": "...", "review": "..." } ],
  "education_entries": [ { "qualification": "Diploma in Marine Engineering",
                           "institution": "Merchant Marine Academy", "note": "optional" } ],
  "language_entries":  [ { "name": "Greek", "level": "Native" } ],
  "disclosure":        "optional footer text",
  "copy":              { "optional": "heading and caption overrides, see below" }
}
```

## Field notes

- **identity.portrait** is a path from the project root, or `null` for no
  photo. For a real person use the path inside the candidate's folder,
  `/private/<candidate-folder>/portrait.<ext>`, jpg or png.
- **contacts** are ordered. Remove an entry to hide it. `href` is optional
  and makes the value a link. Every value must fit `layout.hero.contacts-width`
  or the hero fails with a message.
- **companies[].id** is optional and defaults to the lower-cased name with
  spaces replaced by hyphens. Ids must be unique.
- **companies[].period** is display text. It is never parsed.
- **companies[].service-months** is the company total. Use it when
  per-vessel months are unknown, together with hidden durations. If every
  vessel also has `months`, the two must agree.
- **ships[].id** stays the same when the same vessel appears again under
  another rank or company. It counts once in the vessel total; months add.
- **ships[].months** are whole service months. Required when durations are
  shown.
- **Contract periods are not supported yet.** Deck careers are usually
  recorded as one date range per contract, not as service months. There is
  no field for that, and the synopsis counts months, vessels and companies.
  This is roadmap item one in `docs/vision.md` (ADR 0007). Until it lands, a
  deck CV with contract periods uses the custom-composition path in
  `docs/guides/build-a-cv.md`, section 7. Do not convert calendar periods
  into months to make the data fit; constitution section 6 forbids it.
- **certificates** accept either a four-string array in the order title,
  scope, issued, review, or an object with those keys.
- **education_entries[].note** is optional and renders small under the
  institution.
- **copy** overrides heading text. Keys and defaults:

```text
experience            "Experience"
experience-subtitle   "Company / vessel type / vessel"
continuation          "Continued / earlier companies"
combined              "Combined service"
total                 "Total experience"
vessels               "Vessels"
companies             "Companies"
certificates          "Certificates & endorsements"
certificates-subtitle "Illustrative register - dates and credentials are fictional"
certificate-columns   ["Certificate", "Scope / record", "Issued", "Expires / review"]
education-languages   "Education & languages"
education             "Education"
languages             "Languages"
page-caption          "EXPERIENCE / CREDENTIALS"
brand                 "FLAGSHIP"
```

When `copy` is given it replaces the whole dictionary, so include every key
you still want.

## Errors you will see

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Candidate requires identity` or `... companies` | Add the missing top-level key |
| `Visible vessel durations require months: <ship>` | Add `months`, or hide durations and give `service-months` |
| `Company service-months does not match vessel months` | Make the total equal the sum |
| `Known vessel months exceed company total` | With partial vessel months, the company total must be at least their sum |
| `Missing months: provide service-months for company <name>` | Durations hidden but neither every vessel's `months` nor a company `service-months` is given |
| `Rank exceeds identity plate` | Shorter rank, smaller `theme.sizes.rank`, or wider `layout.hero.plate-width` |
| `Contact group is too tall for the hero` | Fewer contact entries on that side, or smaller `layout.hero.contacts-gap` |
| `Company IDs must be unique` | Give the second company a different `id` |
| `Name exceeds identity plate` | Shorter name, smaller `theme.sizes.name`, or wider `layout.hero.plate-width` |
| `Contact exceeds hero column` | Shorter value or wider `layout.hero.contacts-width` |
