# Verification

Read this to know what `python tests/run.py` proves and how to read its
output.

## Run

```powershell
python tests/run.py                       # Typst on PATH
python tests/run.py --typst C:/path/to/typst.exe
```

Output goes to a new `builds/tests-<timestamp>/` folder. It contains every
compiled PDF, a `.log` with the compiler's stderr per case, a `report.json`,
and per-check folders with `result.json` and, on a raster mismatch, a
`diff-N.png` highlighting changed pixels.

## What it checks

1. **Frozen inputs.** Every path in `tests/baseline.json` still has its
   recorded SHA-256. Runs first and last.
2. **Engineer exact match.** `examples/engineer.typ` renders two pages that
   equal `reference/Marine-Engineer-CV-v11.pdf` pixel for pixel at 144 dpi,
   with identical whitespace-normalised text per page.
3. **Hidden durations.** The same example with `vessel-durations=false` keeps
   every vessel name and rank at the same coordinates and emits no duration
   text.
4. **Captain examples.** Both compile to two pages; silver and classic have
   identical text; no "Engineer" wording appears.
5. **Every PDF.** Expected page count, no empty page, all fonts embedded, no
   text outside the page.
6. **Fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`:**

| Fixture | Cases |
|---|---|
| `data.typ` | Duration parts, totals 138 months / 23 vessels / 6 companies, vessel dedup, company-only months; rejects missing months, mismatched totals, negative months |
| `components.typ` | Hero renders with and without portrait or contacts; rejects a name or email that does not fit |
| `options.typ` | Company-only months, all optional fields empty, a long vessel name whose duration wraps, with and without durations |
| `pagination.typ` | Three pages with a company split across pages; rejects overflow and duplicate allocation |
| `certificate-continuation.typ` | Fifty rows, header repeats on page two |
| `skills.typ` | Titles, one to three columns, wrapping, two themes, SVG and plain bullets |

Negative cases assert on the exact error text so a message change is a test
change.

## Reading a failure

- `AssertionError: ('engineer', ...)` with stderr: the example does not
  compile. Read the `.log`.
- `Raster mismatch on page N`: open `exact/diff-N.png`. Any non-black pixel
  is a change from v11.
- `Frozen file changed: <path>`: an input under the manifest was edited.
  Either revert it or follow the constitution's procedure for a new
  reference.

## Adding a check

Add a fixture with `sys.inputs` cases, then a few lines in `run.py` that
compile it and assert on the PDF. Keep the runner linear and readable; it is
the specification of what "passing" means.
